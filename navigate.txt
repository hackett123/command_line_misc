The command line is a very powerful tool and can do just about everything that you can do with your mouse and your screen.

There are different tools that the command line allows for.

Section 1 : Navigating Files
	cd : set current directory. cd alone will go to the home directory, cd .. will go back one directory. cd x will go to x, if x is in the current directory. cd x/y will go to y, if y is in x and x is in the current directory.

ls : lists files and directories within working directory

-C  -- list entries in columns sorted vertically
-F  -- append file type indicators
-R  -- list subdirectories recursively
-S  -- sort by size
-a  -- list entries starting with .
-d  -- list directory entries instead of contents
-g  -- long listing but without owner information
-h  -- print sizes in human readable form
-l  -- long listing
-m  -- comma separated
-o  -- display file flags
-r  -- reverse sort order

mv x y/z -> moves file x into directory y with name z. can be used to rename files by not specifying the directory y. This will theremore move x from the working directory to the working directory with the name z.

mkdir -> makes new directory in your working directory

cp x y -> copies a file x and names it y
cp -R x y-> copies directory recursively with all of its files included

pwd -> prints working directory

rm -> remove file

rm -r -> remove directory (r is for recursively)

cat file -> print file contents (cat for concatenate)
cat file | wc -w -> print word count in file
cat file | wc -l -> lines
cat file | wc -c -> characters

head x -> prints out first 10 lines of file x
tail x -> prints out last 10 lines of file x

grep word file -> returns the lines where word was found in file
grep -n word file -> includes line number
grep -i word file -> case insensitive
grep --color word file -> colors the matching text
grep -v word file -> returns lines that DON'T contain word

history -> show command line history.
history | tail -> last ten commands

clear -> clears screen

sudo -> preface commands with sudo to enter superuser model

ssh -> secure shell protocol. ssh username@host and enter password to log into the shell of that computer.
	Note that ssh is super powerful and can do wonderful things. I haven't used it before so I am not going in depth on it, but it is used to remote log in to another computer and you can do a whole bunch of shit with it, including putting files from that computer and putting it onto your own computer and a bunch of other things.
