Section 2 : vim

	Vim is the editor of choice for many developers. It is a 'modal' text editor based on the vi editor by Bill Joy. Modal means key inputs can do different things.

	Mode 1 : Insert Mode
		- Enter from command mode with 'i'
		- Escape with 'esc' -> Command Mode
	Mode 2 : Command Mode
		- This is the default mode and is used to navigate the file, cut/copy/paste, delete, search/replace, undo/redo.
		h moves the cursor one character to the left.
		j moves the cursor down one line.
		k moves the cursor up one line.
		l moves the cursor one character to the right.
		0 moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
		$ moves the cursor to the end of the line.
		w move forward one word.
		b move backward one word.
		G move to the end of the file.
		gg move to the beginning of the file.
		`. move to the last edit.
	- Do multiple iterations of a command at a time by prefacing it with a number. For example, '6w' will move forward six words.

	-Delete Commands :
		d starts the delete operation.
		dw will delete a word.
		d0 will delete to the beginning of a line.
		d$ will delete to the end of a line.
		dgg will delete to the beginning of the file.
		dG will delete to the end of the file.
		u will undo the last operation.
		Ctrl-r will redo the last undo.

	-Combinations of navigation keys and edit keys can do fun things! 'dgg' will delete to the beginning of the file, for example.

	-Search and Replace
		'/word' will search for word. hit n to find the next instance, or N to find the prevous instnace. Reverse this process by using '?word' instead.
		'%s/word/replacement_word/gc' will search through document and replace word with its replacement, but ask to confirm first.

	-Copy and Paste
		- Deleting a section automatically copies it. hit 'p' to paste it.
		- Select text : 'v' in command mode and move with h/k/j/l to highlight from that point.
		- Select larger chunks : 'V' to highlight entire lines at a time and use h/k/j/l
		- Select columns (useful for databases or similar) -> Ctrl-v
		- Once selected, hit 'y' to 'yank' it to the buffer and then p to paste wherever.

	Mode 3 : Last-Line Mode
		-Enter from command mode with ':'
		-q -> quit
		-w -> write to file (overwrites and therefore saves)
